                        <p>The ruins of the ancient city of Aksum are found close to Ethiopia's northern border. Ethiopia, when the Kingdom of Aksum was the most powerful state between the Roman Empire and Persia. The massive ruins, dating from the 1st and the 13th century AD, include monolithic obelisks, giant stelae, royal tombs and the ruins of ancient castles. Long after its political decline in the 10th century, Ethiopian emperors continued to be crowned in Aksum.</p>
                        <p> The Obelisk of Axum is a 4th-century AD, 24-meter-tall (79-feet) granite stele/obelisk, weighing 160 tonnes, in the city of Axum in Ethiopia. It is ornamented with two false doors at the base and features decorations resembling windows on all sides. The obelisk ends in a semi-circular top part, which used to be enclosed by metal frames.</p>

						<p>  Lalibela is a town in Amhara Region, northern Ethiopia famous for monolithic rock-cut churches. The whole of Lalibela offers an exceptional testimony to the medieval and post-medieval civilization of Ethiopia.Lalibela is one of Ethiopia's holiest cities, second only to Aksum, and a center of pilgrimage.The population of Lalibela is almost completely Ethiopian Orthodox Christian. Ethiopia is one of the earliest nations to adopt Christianity in the first half of the fourth century, and its historical roots date to the time of the Apostles. The churches themselves date from the seventh to thirteenth centuries, and are traditionally dated to the reign of the Zagwe dynasty king Gebre Mesqel Lalibela (1181–1221 AD).
						The layout and names of the major buildings in Lalibela are widely accepted, especially by local clergy, to be a symbolic representation of Jerusalem. This has led some experts to date the current church forms to the years following the capture of Jerusalem in 1187 by Muslim leader, Saladin.
						Lalibela is located in the Semien Wollo Zone of the Amhara Region, at roughly 2,500 meters above sea level. It is the main town in Lasta woreda, which was formerly part of Bugna woreda. The Rock-Hewn Churches were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1978.</p>

                        <p> The castle of Emperor Johannes IV is the main attraction of the city of Makale, located in the north of Ethiopia. The well-preserved royal palace with high battlements is now a historical museum, where the imperial attributes of the XIX century are kept.The castle was built by Emperor Johannes IV in the 1870s as the official royal residence . Originally he lived in Debre Favor where one can still see the ruins of the early imperial palace. Subsequently, 
						Johannes returned to his native region and moved the capital to Makel, where he lived until his death in 1889 at the Battle of Metema.Besides the fact that Johannes is known as a great general, he was also a convinced Christian. Therefore, the emperor built his palace surrounded by many temples to show his commitment to Christianity. The architecture of the imperial palace was designed under the strong influence of the Gondar castles , which served as a home to the emperors of Ethiopia in the 17th-18th centuries. </p>
